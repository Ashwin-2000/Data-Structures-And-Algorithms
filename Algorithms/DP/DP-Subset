DP subset

What is subset ? 
- It is a combination of n elements in the set i.e not repetation of pattern [ [1,2] == [2,1] ] 
- It contains no duplicate


Consider a set = { 1 , 2 , 3 }
The subsets are :
    [NULL]
    [ 1 ]
    [ 2 ]
    [ 3 ]
    [ 1 , 2]
    [ 1 , 3 ]
    [ 2 , 3 ]
    [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]

No of subsets of set containg 'n' elements = 2^n
why ? 
    There is only two possibility for the element on calculating subset,
        1. It is a part of subset
        2. It is not a part of subset

SUBSET[array] - SUBSEQUENCE[string] are same. They need not to be contagious.
Since the have only two decisions to make the form binary tree.So, the can be 
reperesented using recurrsion.

SUBSEQUENCE vs SUBSTRING
Substring are contagious where as the subsequence need not to be contagious.
Substring is a part of subset.

-   In subarray , the subarray within the subarray helps to establish the condition
    Eg: Longest palindrome string in "baabbaac"
           "b`aabbaa`c"
              |____|
              aabbaa    --> It is longest palindorme
               |__| 
               abba     --> It is also a palindrome
               |__|
                bb      --> It is also a palindrome


The problems finding every combinations and comparing them is also falls in theis category.

Recurr solution can be arrived by 
    - Finding the possible solutions with the element included in subset.
    - Finding the possible solutions with the element excluded in subset.

In otherwords , the contain two state , include state and exclude state
    - minimum subset
    - 

SUB-ARRAY
1. Min size subarray which gives sum/product/.. of target      ==>Target
2. Subarray that gives minimum sum/product/..                  ==>No target

problems
1.Find the largest sum of contagious subarray in array
2.


FROM START TO END REACH THE Target
1. Refueling the tank
2. Minimum number of jumps to reach last
