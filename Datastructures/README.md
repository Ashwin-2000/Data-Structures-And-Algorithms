# DATA STRUCTURES - An Intro

> Data Structures - _Structuring the data_

The data can be any thing

- It can be weight of student in the class
- It can be marks of students
- It can be objects of class car

We have a zillon of Data in our world.But simple ocean of data is useless
unless it is churned into information

- Data - _collection of facts_

- Information - _collection of releated and meaningful data_

> The DATA STRUCTURES evolved by storing the data in such a way so that we can retive the information in easy way
> The DATA STRUCTURES are just a way to represent the data.

Data Structures types :

1. Linear Data Structures
2. Non Linear Data Structures

> _Linearity and Non Linearity is not based memory allocation_ :
> It is not about contagious or non-contagious memory allocation
> It is about the connection of data in linear or branched fashion

Linear Data Structures :

1. [Array](./Array)
2. [Linked List](./Linked%20List)

   Auxillary Data Structures : Linear but important data structure implemented using either Array or Linked List

   - [Stack](./Stack%20and%20Queue/Stack)
   - [Queue](./Stack%20and%20Queue/Queue)

Non Linear Data Structures :

1. [Trees](./Trees)
2. [Graphs](./Graphs)

We use one Data strucute to represent other.For example,the Graph can be implemented using Matrix(Array of Array) and also using Adjacency List(Vector of Vector).

Why this much data structures and more ?

- Because of the different types of applications and usecases
- In some application we need to find things faster than inserting the data. In some we need to insert in fastest possible way
- Like this for vairous application and use caes data strucuters differ the above are most common and depending on the usecase
- we construct any type of data structure
