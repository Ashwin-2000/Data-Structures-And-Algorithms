# TREES

## Classification of trees

- By maximum number of branches

  - Binary Tree - Atmost two Branches(Childrens)
  - Ternary Tree - Atmost three Branches(Childrens)
  - N-Ary Tree - Atmost 'n' Branches(Childrens)

- By Heights of Subtree

  - Balanced Tree
  - Unbalanced Tree

---

### Trees to implement

- Binary tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap/Priority Queue

## Trees to know about

- Balanced Tree
  - AVL tree
  - Red-Black tree
  - Splay tree
- B tree
- B+ tree
- B- tree
- Trie
- Segment Tree
- Suffix tree

## Special Trees

- Empty-tree : a tree without any node
- Root-tree : a tree with only one node
- Skew-tree : Tree where all parent nodes contains only left child (Left Skewed tree) or only right child(Right Skewed tree)
- Binary Search Tree : a tree with condition _**Left_child < Parent < Right_child**_
- Heap : a tree where parent node is greater(or smaller) than children
- B- & B+ Tree : indexing in Database
- Trie : Called as **digital tree or prefix tree** used for locating specific keys from within the set.
- suffix tree : For quick pattern searching

## Why there are so much variation of trees ?

- The different types of trees are used for diffrent purposes.The difference in araises in

  - how the Parent-child are related ?
  - how many are branched (branching factor) ?
  - how effecient to search ?
  - how efficient to insert ?
  - how efficinet to delete ?
  - And so on...
